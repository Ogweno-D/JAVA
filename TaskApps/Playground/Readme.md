### 1. Rules for Naming Variables

- Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
- Names must begin with a letter.
- Names should start with a lowercase letter and cannot contain whitespace.
- Names can also begin with `$` and `_`.
- Names are case-sensitive (e.g., `myVar` and `myvar` are different variables).
- Reserved words (like Java keywords such as `int` or `boolean`) cannot be used as names.
